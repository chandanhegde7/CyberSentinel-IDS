# CyberSentinel-IDS ðŸš€

## Overview
CyberSentinel-IDS is an AI-driven Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to detect cyber threats in real-time. It uses advanced machine learning models to classify network traffic as normal or malicious.

## Features
âœ… Real-time **intrusion detection** using scapy  
âœ… Machine learning models trained on **CIC-IDS2017** dataset  
âœ… API for integration with **security tools**  
âœ… Automated **CI/CD pipeline** for model updates  

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CyberSentinel-IDS.git

2. install dependecies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the detection script (will be implemented in future steps).

Dataset
We will use CIC-IDS2017, a real-world dataset containing normal and attack traffic.
